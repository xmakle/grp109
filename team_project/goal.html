      <h2>List of Goals:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Create a website that documents our learning progress in this course</li>
        <li>Create a visual timeline to showcase the progress visually</li>
        <li>Accurately document our learning progress and visualize it clearly</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Where we Landed:</h2>
      <p>Overall, we came short of our goals here. For one, the vision I had for a timeline never came to fruition.
         Aside from this, I think we had the capability to style the website to look cleaner and more professional,
         which would aid the clarity of the information provided. That said, there is a lot of information provided
         by this website, and it does accurately document the things we learned, as well as proof of our progress 
         in the fact that we were able to create this website.
